### The Problem:
- You need to check if you can "rename" each letter of string `s` consistently into letters of string `t`, **with no overlap or ambiguity** (one-to-one mapping in both directions).

### The Approach:
1. **Create two dictionaries (hashmaps):**
   - `m1` maps every character in `s` to its corresponding character in `t`
   - `m2` maps every character in `t` back to its corresponding character in `s`
   - This ensures the mapping is unique and reversible.

2. **Loop through both strings at the same time, using zip:**
   - For every character pair `(c1, c2)`:
     - **Check existing mappings:**
        - If `c1` was already mapped to some `c2` before (`c1 in m1`), verify that it’s still the same `c2`. If not, mapping is NOT isomorphic—return False.
        - If `c2` was already mapped to some `c1` before (`c2 in m2`), verify that it’s still the same `c1`. If not, mapping is NOT isomorphic—return False.
     - **If no mapping exists yet:** Create both new mappings (`m1[c1]=c2`, `m2[c2]=c1`).

3. **Why does this work?**
   - By always checking both directions, you reveal every possible “cheating” scenario (e.g. two letters in `s` map to the same in `t`, or vice versa) and reject it instantly.
   - You only return True at the very end, after confirming that every mapping is unique and matched all the way through.

### Example:
- s = "egg", t = "add"
   - e → a
   - first g → d (record g→d and d→g)
   - second g → d (check: is g→d and d→g? Yes → good)
   - No conflicts: Valid isomorphic mapping, return True at end.

### Intuition:
- You aren’t just substituting characters—you’re enforcing *unique renaming* with strict rules.
- If any letter tries to “change its assigned identity,” the pattern fails.

    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        m1={}
        m2={}
        for c1,c2 in zip(s,t):
            if c1 in m1 and m1[c1]!=c2:
                return False
            elif c2 in m2 and m2[c2]!=c1:
                return False
            else:
                m1[c1]=c2
                m2[c2]=c1
            return True
        print ( m1 )
        print(" ")
        print ( m2 )
```
